    "### What is the countdown numbers game?\n",
    "The countdown game is where contestants are challenged on their numeracy and word making skills. In the 'letters' version of the game,  the goal is to create the longest and most complex words out of a randomly selected mix of 9 consonants and 9 vowels. The numbers version of the game, the player must combine 6 randomly selected numbers to get as close as possible to a randomly generated total using just the four basic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). We will be just looking at the numbers version of the game."

    "- <b>Pure functions - </b> The best scenario in functional programming is the ability to create pure functions. This means creating functions whose result is based purely on the input parameters, and whose operation causes no side effects or  imbalances when brought together, that is, makes no external impact besides the return value. The reason this is so effective is that a pure function can be reduced to only the arguments and the return value. The code above uses this to its advantage as it contains many pure functions which always produce the same output with the same arguments and they do not change or modify the input variable, although there are some features which have to interact with the broader context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Immutibility - </b> Another functional aspect of this code is that the variables are not modified outside of the functions. Instead, the return value from calling the functions reflects the computation done. This helps avoid any side effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>First class functions -</b> First class functions are treated as a thing in themselves that can be ran by themselves and treated independantly. Functional programming takes advantage of language support when giving the ability to use functions as variables, arguments and return values to create robust code. We can see this in the <i>solution function</i> which returns <i> iterative([], digits)</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Dealing with collections -</b> Another beautiful feature of working with functional code is having the ability to work with massive collections with very little effort. As we seen above, we could apply our functionality to all items in a collection of enourmous size as is the ideology behind functional programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Generators -</b> I also used generators in this project to retrieve the large and small numbers from the options of [25, 50, 75, 100] for large numbers and random numbers between 1 and 10 for the smaller numbers."
