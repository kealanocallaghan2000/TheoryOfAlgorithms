    "### What is the countdown numbers game?\n",
    "The countdown game is where contestants are challenged on their numeracy and word making skills. In the 'letters' version of the game,  the goal is to create the longest and most complex words out of a randomly selected mix of 9 consonants and 9 vowels. The numbers version of the game, the player must combine 6 randomly selected numbers to get as close as possible to a randomly generated total using just the four basic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). We will be just looking at the numbers version of the game."

Simply adding another number or operator and the task at hand grows exponentially, quickly becoming to large of a task even on a high end computer. \n",

    "Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a method for representing expressions in which the operator symbol is placed after the arguments being operated on. For example, the following RPN expression will produce the sum of 2 and 3: 2 3 +. The benefit of using RPN is that brackets are not required to represent the order of evaluation, which is perfect for computing problems. Another example is to represent <b>(3+4) x 5</b> as <b>3 4 + 5 x</b>. \n",
