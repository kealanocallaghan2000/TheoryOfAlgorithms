# Theory Of Algorithms
My assessment repository for the Theory Of Algorithms assessment 2022.

## Overview of this repository

### About the project
This repository is a demonstration of my research and studies into the topics of The Bounded Post Correspondence Problem and The Countdown Numbers Game using python and different programming techniques in order to look deeper as some of the theory behind algorithms and their complexities in computing.
